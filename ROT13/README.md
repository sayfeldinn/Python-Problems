ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the latin alphabet and it's frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.

Test examples:

"EBG13 rknzcyr." -> "ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -> "Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"
